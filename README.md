# Teiai Group Landing Page

This is a landing page based on the fictional (and evil) Teiai Corporation from the manga Kaiji. It was originally created for the Odin Project's Foundation Course. The lesson and project outlines can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/790. After the course, I revisited the project as an opportunity to learn Vue and Nuxt. The project is not finished and needs a lot of work, but I plan to revisit it sometime soon.
